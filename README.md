# NCEA Level 2 Website Assignment
A website built in 2020 for the NCEA level 2 design (AS91891) and development (AS91897) Digital Technology assignments.

The purpose of this website was to inform people how to make eco-friendly travel plans, however it wasn't required that the site was actually filled with the content, only that it was functional. Thus, the final product is more of a skeleton of what the website could be.
